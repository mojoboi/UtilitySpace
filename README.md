A modern web application designed to help households or shared living spaces easily track the availability of common utilities like the kitchen, washing machine, and dryer. See who is using what and since when, all within a clean, easy-to-use interface.

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project focuses on front-end interactions and utilizes `localStorage` for data persistence within a single browser session.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Resource Tracking:** View the current status (Free / In Use) of shared resources (Kitchen, Washer, Dryer).
* **Usage Details:** See who marked a resource as "In Use" and the time they started.
* **User Profiles:** Set up your Name, House Number, and Room Number to identify yourself.
* **Edit Profile:** Easily update your saved profile information.
* **Mark In Use / Free:** Simple buttons to claim or release a resource.
* **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing. Theme preference is saved locally.
* **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive design inspired by modern app interfaces, using the Roboto font and Font Awesome icons.
* **Local Persistence:** User profile and resource statuses are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, remembering the state between page refreshes (on the same browser profile).
